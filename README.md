# QuitRunningApps

QuitRunningApps is a macOS application built with SwiftUI. It automates the process of closing multiple running applications on your Mac with a single click.

QuitRunningApps adheres to SwiftUI principles and Appleâ€™s recommended practices.

The app is designed to be lightweight and fast - simply start it, quit all running apps, and enjoy a well-deserved break!

The latest version of the application is available at [Releases](https://github.com/pbalinov/QuitRunningApps/releases) and more information can be found in [Wiki](https://github.com/pbalinov/QuitRunningApps/wiki) pages.
