# QuitRunningApps

QuitRunningApps application is built on SwiftUI for macOS. It aims to automate the process of closing multiple running applications on your Mac. 

It is my personal routine to quit all running applications at the end of the day before closing the lid of my Mac. It also helps me ensure that no documents will be left unsaved.

An Apple Automator script can be created for this purpose, but it never worked well for me. I had to run it several times before it closes all the running programs. 

This triggered the creation of this small application. It follows SwiftUI concepts and aims to be lightweight and fast â€“ start it, quit all running apps and have a good rest!
