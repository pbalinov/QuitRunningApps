# QuitRunningApps

QuitRunningApps is a macOS application built with SwiftUI. It automates the process of closing multiple running applications on your Mac with a single click.

I developed this app because I have a routine of quitting all open applications at the end of the day before closing my Mac. This practice helps me ensure that no documents are left unsaved.

While an Apple Automator script can achieve this, I found it unreliable, often requiring multiple runs to close all programs. This experience led me to create QuitRunningApps, which adheres to SwiftUI principles and Apple’s recommended practices. 

The app is designed to be lightweight and fast—simply start it, quit all running apps, and enjoy a well-deserved break!
